# Diabetes-Progression-Regressor-ML
A basic Linear Regression model in Machine Learning ,that help users to understand how  a simple regressor works.

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques. The analysis and model implementation are done in a Jupyter Notebook (Diabetes.ipynb).
The dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements that help in predicting diabetes in patients.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early prediction can help in prevention and better treatment planning.
 
The objective of this project is:
• To analyze medical data
• To preprocess and clean the dataset
• To train a machine learning model
• To evaluate the model's performance

The dataset typically includes the following features:

•Pregnancies
•Glucose
•Blood Pressure
•Skin Thickness
•Insulin
•BMI (Body Mass Index)
•Diabetes Pedigree Function
•Age
•Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
